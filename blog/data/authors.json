But he\u2019s more than just an admin: he\u2019s a hands-on developer, a creative thinker, a storyteller, and a tech-driven problem solver.\nFrom building software to exploring aviation, from crafting worlds to running real-life projects, Mahdi brings that same energy into all the projects: innovation, precision, and zero shortcuts.\n\nThis platform runs on his mind, his work, and his consistency \u2014 and it shows.",
